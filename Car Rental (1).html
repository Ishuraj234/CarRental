            <p>BMW India has expanded its line-up with the launch of the new M8 Coupe priced at Rs. 2.23 crore (ex-showroom). The all-new 8 Series line-up is BMW India's new flagship offering and the M8 Coupe locks horns against the Mercedes-AMG S63 Coupe in the segment. The BMW M8 and the 8 Series Gran Coupe will be sold digitally via the company's Contactless Experience online retail platform, while the automaker's dealerships slowly resume operations as lockdown restrictions are eased in several parts. The company has launched only the M8 Coupe in India. BMW also has convertible and Gran Coupe variants of the M8 in other markets. There's also the more powerful Competition version available in all three body styles, which has an extra 25 bhp of power. But we are not getting that either.</p>

             <p>   Piera Kaempf, Head of BMW Product Management said, "The number 8 has always been very special to BMW, and it has always been associated with dream cars. And this is exactly what these two cars are - the 8 Series Gran Coupe and the M8 Coupe. They are dream cars, they touch you emotionally, they appeal to all your senses, and of course they are cars that you just want to have." Speaking about the M8 Coupe, she adds, "The M8 Coupe is even more extroverted in its design, it's even more aggressive in its design and you can see that right away with the M-Kidney (grille) and also the end exhaust system and some other features. And this car is all about performance. It has the newest V8 engine technology with 600 horsepower, 750 Nm of torque, and a acceleration from 0-100 kmph in 3.3 seconds."</p>
             <img src="" alt="BMW">
                <p>    The new BMW M8 Coupe distinguishes itself from the 8 Series Gran Coupe with the M treatment. The two-door model gets the swept-back headlamps, sculpted bonnet with muscular character lines, wide kidney grille, and aerodynamic creases on the sides. The split taillights taking prominence at the rear, while the bumpers look aggressive and sport larger air intakes and sportier alloy wheels. The M8 Coupe uses carbon fibre in abundance, especially for the roof, while the flared Aluminium wings with M gills and M8 designation emphasise track width and wheel size. The model comes with a rear spoiler lip, M-spec rear diffuser and a double flow exhaust system with twin tailpipes.</p>

                    <p>    The cabin on the BMW M8 Coupe is accentuated with Merino leather upholstered seats, ambient lighting, Harman sound system and M Sports seats.

                        <p>    The BMW M8 Coupe is powered by the 4.4-litre V8 twin-turbocharged motor that is one of the most powerful engines to come from the company's stable. The petrol engine develops 592 bhp and 750 Nm of peak torque. The motor is paired with an 8-speed Shifttronic automatic transmission and also gets All-Wheel Drive that sends power to all four wheels. The coupe is capable of sprinting from 0-100 kmph in just 3.3 seconds. The car is also equipped with the Adaptive M Suspension that enables individual response behavior for each wheel at the touch of a button. Drivers also get different driving modes - Comfort, Sport and Sport+. The safety tech is loaded as well and includes six airbags, attentive assistance, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), ABS, e-brake and more. There's also optional BMW Night Vision with person recognition that customers can opt for. Like all BMWs, the M8 Coupe also gets 50:50 weight distribution for that dynamic driving experience.</p>

            <p>    The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 was part of BMW's electrified fleet and was marketed under the BMW i sub-brand.

                <p>   The 2015 BMW i8 accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds[16][17] and had an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).[5] The 2015 model year i8 had a 7.1-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivered an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the U.S. EPA cycle, the range in EV mode was 24 km (15 mi).[8] The battery capacity of both the BMW i8 Roadster and the i8 Coupe was increased to 11.6 kWh in 2018, allowing the NEDC electric range to rise to 55 km (34 mi) for the coupé and 53 km (33 mi) for the roadster.[6]</p>

                    <p>   The BMW i8 coupé had a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg‑imp; 112.0 mpg‑US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km.

          <h2>BMW XM Label Red</h2>
       <p> More powerful, more exclusive, more extravagant: The BMW XM Label Red brings together an M HYBRID system with extra power and bespoke design accents that showcase its standout performance attributes to unmistakable effect.</p>

       <p>     With a system output of 550 kW (748 hp), the BMW XM Label Red is the most powerful BMW M model ever made. The distinguishing features of the performance-maximising XM variant include an accent band in Toronto Red metallic, although a black accent band also can be specified.</p> 
      <p>    Its eight-cylinder plug-in hybrid drive with a superior system output of 550 kW (748 hp) and 1,000 Nm of torque makes the BMW XM Label Red the most powerful BMW M model ever made and, compared to the BMW XM, once again brings increased dynamics onto the road.</p>

      <p>     The high-performance 4.4-litre V8 in virtuoso interaction with the 145 kW (197 hp) electrical machine generates an inspiring forward thrust and that distinctive engine sound typical of M. A pre-gearing stage patented by BMW is used to increase the torque produced by the electric motor to an effective maximum of 450 Nm at the transmission input for the motor. </p>

      <br>    As a result, the BMW XM Label Red needs just 3.8 seconds to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h. Its top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h but rises to 290 km/h with the optional M Driver’s Package.  </br>
